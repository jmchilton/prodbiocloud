Production Galaxy Instances with CloudMan and CloudBioLinux
========================================================================

Typically, CloudMan is used to spin up a dedicated Galaxy virtual
cluster for a single user or small group on Amazon EC2. This document
outlines methods for deploying customized Galaxy instances that are
more suitable for production environments - these enhancements include
enabling load balancing, external authentication, SSL, reporting, and
taking advantage of external resources such as dedicated file and
database servers and even compute resources outside of the cloud.
